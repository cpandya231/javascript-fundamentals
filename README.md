# Javascript Fundamentals [![Awesome](https://cdn.rawgit.com/sindresorhus/awesome/d7305f38d29fed78fa85652e3a63e154dd8e8829/media/badge.svg)](https://github.com/cpandya231/javascript-fundamentals)

This project will provide fundamental concepts of Javascript. This will be one shop stop to get the basics right and also work as a flashcards.

 ## Hoisting
* Conceptually, Javascript moves all variables, functions, class to the top of the code. This is called Hoisting.
* Javascript does not reshuffle any code but at compile time it identifies variable, function declaration first. Variable assignment happens at later stage.

#### Example
```
var myName;
console.log(myName);
myName = ‘Sunil’;

Result:
{level: "ERROR", line: -12, message: "Uncaught SyntaxError: Invalid or unexpected token", type: "js"}
```
